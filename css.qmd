## Definition

(Wikipedia) Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).

## History

CSS was initially released in 1996 as a standard by the W3C (*World Wide Web Consortium*). The latest version is **CSS4**.

*W3C is the main international standards organization for the World Wide Web. Founded in 1994.*

A relevant language: [SCSS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets)](https://sass-lang.com/): A scripting language compiled into CSS.

## What is CSS style rule?

```{css eval=F}
/* Declare/define a selector `body`
type: element
rule: two properties; each has a value.
*/
body { 
  background-color: #989898;
  color: aliceblue;
}
/* Define a selector `img`
type: element
rule: one property width 
*/
img {
  width:80%;
}
/* define a class selector `submission`
type: class
rule: 7 properties each with a value */
.submission{
  background-color: #3671A2;
  background-image: url("imgs/ostrich.png");
  border: dotted #a2a7a8;
  border-width: 10px 4px;
  border-radius: 10px 40px;
  font-weight: bold;
  color: white;
}
```

```{python eval=F,include=F}
import sys
print(sys.path)
```

## Why using CSS?

1.  **Separate content from appearance**

2.  Enable Code reuse, maintainability, variety, diversity

## Where is CSS?

Three types of location:

-   internal css: embedded `STYLE element tag` inside HEAD element

-   internal css: inline `style attribute` with html elements

-   external css: `LINK element` links HTML to external css scripts

## An Analogy

From the design perspective, with the support of CSS technology, Web pages is analogous to people in terms of dressing style.

> People & their styles

-   A person normally has several cloths.
-   People have diverse styles.
-   Even with the same person, his/her style mostly varies with a lot of internal and external factors-culture, age, job, emotion, location, experience and to name a few.

> Web Pages & their Look-and-Feel

-   A static Web page is analogous to a person.
-   The content is organized in a page by HTML script. A page can have multiple appearances by style rules.
-   The style rules are declared in CSS language.
-   The same Web content can be decorated and styled differently in accordance with its target audience and purpose.

> Therefore, Web designers often create more than one style for the same HTML page, and implement them in CSS scripts.
