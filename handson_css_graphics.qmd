#### Text Page 276 Handson 5.1

In this Hands-On Practice, you will place a logo and a photo graph on a web page. _Create a new folder called kayakch5_. The images used in this Hands-On Practice are located in the **student files** `chapter5/starters folder`. Copy the `kayakdc.gif` and `hero.jpg` files into your kayakch5 folder. A starter
version of the Home page is ready for you in the student files. Copy the chapter5/starter.html file into your kayakch5 folder. When you complete this Hands-On Practice, your page
will look similar to the one shown in Figure 5.6 â€”with two images. Launch VS Code and open the file.
